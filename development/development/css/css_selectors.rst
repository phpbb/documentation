CSS Selectors
-------------

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, one of the most fundamental, critical aspects of writing maintainable and scalable CSS is selectors. Their specificity, their portability, and their reusability all have a direct impact on the mileage you will get out of the CSS, and the headaches it might bring you.

Selector Intent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important when writing CSS that you scope the selectors correctly, and that you're selecting the right things for the right reasons. Selector Intent is the process of deciding and defining what you want to style and how you will go about selecting it. For example, if you are wanting to style your website’s main navigation menu, a selector like this would be incredibly unwise:

.. code:: css

    header ul { }

This selector’s intent is to style any ``ul`` inside any ``header`` element, whereas your intent was to style the site’s main navigation. This is poor Selector Intent: you can have any number of ``header`` elements on a page, and they in turn can house any number of ``uls``, so a selector like this runs the risk of applying very specific styling to a very wide number of elements. This will result in having to write more CSS to undo the greedy nature of such a selector.

A better approach would be a selector like:

.. code:: css

    .site-nav { }

An unambiguous, explicit selector with good Selector Intent. Explicitly selecting the right thing for exactly the right reason.

Poor Selector Intent is one of the biggest reasons for headaches on CSS projects. Writing rules that are far too greedy, and apply very specific treatments via very far reaching selectors. This causes unexpected side effects and leads to very tangled stylesheets, with selectors overstepping their intentions and impacting and interfering with otherwise unrelated rulesets.

CSS cannot be encapsulated, it is inherently leaky, but you can mitigate some of these effects by not writing such globally operating selectors: **your selectors should be as explicit and well reasoned as your reason for wanting to select something.**

Reusability
~~~~~~~~~~~

With a move toward a more component based approach to constructing UIs, the idea of reusability is paramount. You want the option to be able to move, recycle, duplicate, and syndicate components across our projects.

To this end, make heavy use of classes. IDs, as well as being hugely over specific, cannot be used more than once on any given page. Classes can be reused an infinite amount of times. Everything you choose, from the type of selector to its name, should lend itself toward being reused.

Location Independence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the ever changing nature of most UI projects, and the move to more component based architectures, it is in your best interest not to style things based on where they are, but on what they are. That is to say, your components’ styling should not be reliant upon where its placed. They should remain entirely location independent.

Let’s take an example of a call-to-action button that has been styled via the following selector:

.. code:: css

    .promo a { }

Not only does this have poor Selector Intent, it will greedily style any and every link inside of a ``.promo`` to look like a button. It is also pretty wasteful as a result of being so locationally dependent: you can’t reuse that button with its correct styling outside of ``.promo`` because it is explicitly tied to that location. A far better selector would have been:

.. code:: css

    .btn { }

This single class can be reused anywhere outside of ``.promo`` and will always carry its correct styling. As a result of a better selector, this piece of UI is more portable, more recyclable, doesn’t have any dependencies, and has much better Selector Intent. **A component shouldn’t have to live in a certain place to look a certain way.**

Portability
~~~~~~~~~~~

Reducing or removing, location dependence means that you can move components around our markup more freely, but how about improving the ability to move classes around components? On a much lower level, there are changes you can make to your selectors that make the selectors themselves, as opposed to the components they create more portable. Take the following example:

.. code:: css

    input.btn { }

This is a *qualified* selector; the leading ``input`` ties this ruleset to only being able to work on ``input`` elements. By omitting this qualification, you allow the reuse of the ``.btn`` class on any element you choose, like an ``a``, for example, or a ``button``.

Qualified selectors do not lend themselves well to being reused, and every selector you write should be authored with reuse in mind.

Of course, there are times when you may want to legitimately qualify a selector, you might need to apply some very specific styling to a particular element when it carries a certain class, for example:

.. code:: css

    /**
     * Embolden and color any element with a class of `.error`.
     */
    .error {
        color: red;
        font-weight: bold;
    }

    /**
     * If the element is a `div`, also give it some box-like styling.
     */
    div.error {
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid;
    }

This is one example where a qualified selector might be justifiable, but the recommend approach would be:

.. code:: css

    /**
     * Text-level errors.
     */
    .error-text {
        color: red;
        font-weight: bold;
    }

    /**
     * Elements that contain errors.
     */
    .error-box {
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid;
    }

This means that you can apply ``.error-box`` to any element, and not just a ``div`` it is more reusable than a qualified selector.

Quasi-Qualified Selectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One thing that qualified selectors can be useful for is signaling where a class might be expected or intended to be used, for example:

.. code:: css

    ul.nav { }

Here you can see that the ``.nav`` class is meant to be used on a ``ul`` element, and not on a ``nav``. By using *quasi-qualified selectors* you can still provide that information without actually qualifying the selector:

.. code:: css

    /*ul*/.nav { }

By commenting out the leading element, you can still leave it to be read, but avoid qualifying and increasing the specificity of the selector.

Naming
~~~~~~

As Phil Karlton once said

    ‘There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache
    invalidation and naming things.’

Without commenting on the former claim here, but the latter has plagued people for years. Our advice with regard to naming things in CSS is to pick a name that is sensible, but somewhat ambiguous: aim for high reusability. For example, instead of a class like ``.site-nav``, choose something like ``.primary-nav``; rather than ``.footer-links``, favor a class like ``.sub-links``.

The differences in these names is that the first of each two examples is tied to a very specific use case: they can only be used as the site’s navigation or the footer’s links respectively. By using slightly more ambiguous names, you can increase the ability to reuse these components in different circumstances.

To quote Nicolas Gallagher:

    'Tying your class name semantics tightly to the nature of the content
    has already reduced the ability of your architecture to scale or be
    easily put to use by other developers.'

That is to say, you should use sensible names or classes. For example ``.border`` or ``.red`` are never advisable, avoid using classes which describe the exact nature of the content and/or its use cases. **Using a class name to describe content is redundant because content describes itself.**

The debate surrounding semantics has raged for years, but it is important that you adopt a more pragmatic, sensible approach to naming things in order to work more efficiently and effectively. Instead of focussing on ‘semantics’, look more closely at sensibility and longevity, choose names based on ease of maintenance, not for their perceived meaning.

Name things for people; they’re the only ones that actually read your classes (everything else merely matches them). Once again, it is better to strive for reusable, recyclable classes rather than writing for specific use cases. Let’s take an example:

.. code:: css

    /**
     * Runs the risk of becoming out of date; not very maintainable.
     */
    .blue { color: blue; }

    /**
     * Depends on location in order to be rendered properly.
     */
    .header span { color: blue; }

    /**
     * Too specific; limits the ability to reuse.
     */
    .header-color { color: blue; }

    /**
     * Nicely abstracted, very portable, doesn’t risk becoming out of date.
     */
    .highlight-color { color: blue; }

It is important to strike a balance between names that do not literally describe the style that the class brings, but also ones that do not explicitly describe specific use cases. Instead of ``.home-page-panel``, choose ``.masthead``; instead of ``.site-nav``, favor ``.primary-nav``; instead of ``.btn-login``, opt for ``.btn-primary``.

Selector Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A topic which is with the quality of today’s browsers, more interesting than it is important, is selector performance. That is to say, how quickly a browser can match the selectors you write in CSS up with the nodes it finds in the DOM.

Generally speaking, the longer a selector is (i.e. the more component parts) the slower it is, for example:

.. code:: css

    body.home div.header ul { }

…is a far less efficient selector than:

.. code:: css

    .primary-nav { }

This is because browsers read CSS selectors right-to-left. A browser will read the first selector as

-  find all ``ul`` elements in the DOM
-  now check if they live anywhere inside an element with a class of ``.header``
-  next check that ``.header`` class exists on a ``div`` element
-  now check that that all lives anywhere inside any elements with a class of ``.home``
-  finally, check that ``.home`` exists on a ``body`` element

The second, in contrast, is simply a case of the browser reading, find all the elements with a class of ``.primary-nav``.

To further compound the problem, the example uses descendant selectors (e.g. ``.foo .bar {}``). The upshot of this is that a browser is required to start with the rightmost part of the selector (i.e. ``.bar``) and keep looking up the DOM indefinitely until it finds the next part (i.e. ``.foo``). This could mean stepping up the DOM dozens of times until a match is found.

This is just one reason why **nesting with preprocessors is often a false economy**; as well as making selectors unnecessarily more specific, and creating location dependency, it also creates more work for the browser.

By using a child selector (e.g. ``.foo > .bar {}``) you can make the process much more efficient, because this only requires the browser to look one level higher in the DOM, and it will stop regardless of whether or not it found a match.

The Key Selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because browsers read selectors right-to-left, the rightmost selector is often critical in defining a selector’s performance: this is called the key selector.

The following selector might appear to be highly performant at first glance. It uses an ID which is nice and fast, and there can only ever be one on a page, so surely this will be a nice and speedy lookup, just find that one ID and then style everything inside of it:

.. code:: css

    #foo * { }

The problem with this selector is that the key selector (``*``) is very, very far reaching. What this selector actually does is find every single node in the DOM (even ``<title>``, ``<link>``, and ``<head>`` elements; everything) and then looks to see if it lives anywhere at any level within #foo. This is a very, very expensive selector, and should most likely be avoided or rewritten.

Thankfully, by writing selectors with good Selector Intent, you are probably avoiding inefficient selectors by default; you are very unlikely to have greedy key selectors if you’re targeting the right things for the right reason.

That said, however, CSS selector performance should be fairly low on your list of things to optimize; browsers are fast, and are only ever getting faster, and it is only on notable edge cases that inefficient selectors would be likely to pose a problem.

As well as their own specific issues, nesting, qualifying, and poor Selector Intent all contribute to less efficient selectors.

General Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your selectors are fundamental to writing good CSS. To very briefly sum up the above sections:

-  **Select what you want explicitly**, rather than relying on circumstance or coincidence. Good Selector Intent will rein in the reach and leak of your styles.
-  **Write selectors for reusability**, so that you can work more efficiently and reduce waste and repetition.
-  **Do not nest selectors unnecessarily**, because this will increase specificity and affect where else you can use your styles.
-  **Do not qualify selectors unnecessarily**, as this will impact the number of different elements you can apply styles to.
-  **Keep selectors as short as possible**, in order to keep specificity down and performance up.

Focussing on these points will keep your selectors a lot more sane and easy to work with on changing and long running projects.

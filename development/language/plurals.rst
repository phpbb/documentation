Plurals
=======

Short Example
=============

The english language is very simple when it comes to plurals:

    *You have 0 elephants, 1 elephant, or 2+ elephants.*

So basically you have 2 different forms: one singular and one plural.


But for some other languages this is quite a bit more difficult. Let's take
the Bosnian language as another example:

    *You have [1/21/31] slon, [2/3/4] slona, [0/5/6] slonova and [7/8/9/11] ...*

The problem with the old system of plurals was that you would have needed to
specify them all, and get a loop in there.


As we are not the first developers facing this problem, it was not really hard
to find a suitable solution. We decided to use the system from
`Unicode.org`_, which is e.g. used by Mozilla.

Plural Rules
============
So we defined the following 16 rules for plurals. First point is the language
family, afterwards there are a number of rows with the following format:
**<key> - <rule>: <example-numbers>**

.. note::

    0 is handled as a special case. If you add a key 0 to your
    array, that will be used in case of 0 independent of the plural rule.

How to use the rules
====================
The first thing your language package needs, is a definition, which rule to
use for your package. This is done in the ``language/xy/common.php`` language
file at the beginning of the array, (Rule #1 is the rule for the English
language and will be used by default, if you don't specify one):

.. code-block:: php

    'PLURAL_RULE' => 1,

The following example is using rule **#13**:

It has the following rows:

* 1 - 1
* 2 - ends in 01-10: 2, 3, ... 9, 10, 101, 102, ...
* 3 - ends in 11-19: 11, 12, ... 18, 19, 111, 112, ...
* 4 - everything else: 20, 21, ...

While the English language only has 2 rows in its array:

.. code-block:: php

    'EXAMPLE' => [
        1 => '1 example',
        2 => '2 or more examples',
    ],

You need to specify the zero-row and 4 rows for the "plurals":

.. code-block:: php

    'EXAMPLE' => [
        1 => '1 example',
        2 => '[0 or number ending with 01-10] examples',
        3 => '[number ending with 11-19] example',
        4 => 'even more examples',
    ],

If you require separate handling for 0, you can simple add the 0-case:

.. code-block:: php

    'EXAMPLE' => [
        0 => 'No example',
        1 => '1 example',
        2 => '[zero is not handled here anymore! Only number ending with 01-10] examples',
        3 => '[number ending with 11-19] example',
        4 => 'even more examples',
    ],

If you forget a line the system will automatically use the row before. So if
you forget to add the *3*-row, it will use *2*-row for 11-19 as well. If there
is no previous row, it uses the last row of the array.


**Ensure your cases are in ascending order**, otherwise the system may produce
unexpected results if any keys are missing or out of order.
